Current bugs:
	None (known, please make a pull request or email me if you find one)
Past bugs:
	Bad sorts break the leaderboard by making consequent sorts not test for the list that the broken sort failed on.
		Branch: Issue-1 
    	Status: FIXED
    	Source: This issue was caused by a subtlety in python "for i in iterable" loops, where deleting something 
        	    from the iterable causes the loop to skip the next object because it's index has been downshifted 
            	without the index of the for loop being changed.
